Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Admin::TableInfo.

2.08  Thu Mar 14 15:02:00 2013
	- Add Postgres to list of databases which have special tables skipped.
	- Extend to handle foreign keys in SQLite, using "pragma foreign_key_list($table_name)".
	- Add an FAQ to explain more about foreign keys and tables with special (i.e. ignored) names.
	- Rewrite to use Hash::FieldHash for class-building.
	- Use App::Office::Contacts to create 2 databases, one under Postgres and one under SQLite.
		Then run examples/table.info.pl on these and save the output as
		docs/contacts.pg.log and docs/contacts.sqlite.log.

2.07  Thu Jun  7  8:40:00 2012
	- 'Use Carp' in TableInfo.pm because with call croak().
		At least I had already put Carp in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.

2.06  Web Feb 16 11:46:00 2011
	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
	- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.

2.05  Fri Jun 25 11:27:00 2010
	- The META.yml file shipped with V 2.04 was faulty. My apologies.

2.04  Fri Jun 18 13:38:00 2010
	- Test with Postgres V 08.03.1100 and DBD::Pg V 2.17.1.
	- With Postgres, note the fact that the 'table' parameter to table_info()
	  	   must now take the value '%' and not the value 'table'.
	- Test with MySql V 5.0.51a and DBD::mysql V 4.014.
	- With MySQL, create tables using these clauses: index, foreign key, engine.
	- Test with SQLite V 3.6.22 and DBD::SQLite V 1.29.
	- With SQLite, ignore table 'sqlite_sequence'.
	- Update docs in various ways.
	- Rename table-info.pl to table.info.pl.

2.03  Sun Feb 21 12:54:56 2010
	- Remove text 'All rights reserved' (for Debian licensing).
	- Remove POD heads 'Required Modules' and 'Changes'.
	- Replace personal doc root with /var/www.
	- Use namespace::autoclean with Moose.

2.02  Wed Feb 10 14:01:44 2010
	- MANIFEST.SKIP updated to exclude MYMETA.yml. Add MYMETA.yml.

2.01  Fri Nov 13 13:20:00 2009
	- Run dos2unix
	- Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES

2.00  Thu Apr 20 11:19:00 2006
	- Add primary key info
	- Add foreign key info
	- Rename parameters to new():
		o table_catalog is now catalog
		o table_schema is now schema
		o column_catalog is now catalog
		o column_schema is now schema
	- Add parameters to new() to support Oracle:
		o table
		o type
	- Document parameter values for:
		o MS Access
		o MySQL
		o Oracle
		o PostgreSQL
	- Update docs
	- Rewrite examples/test-table-info.pl to use Data::Dumper
	- Chop examples/test-table-info.cgi because it added nothing useful to the distro

1.03  Thu Oct 27 19:40:00 2005
	- Simplify code in new() to no longer check if caller is an object
		as per the new standard on such matters
	- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
		META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}',
		which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file,
		which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:
		ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

1.02  Mon Jul 19 14:43:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Add comments to the POD about having tested against MySQL V 4, MS Access V 2 (sic) and MS Access 2002
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.01  Wed Mar  3 10:08:41 2004
	- Add method refresh() to re-create internal data by re-calling DBI's table_info().
		This has to be called after you change the database structure, eg by doing
		'drop table <some table>' or something similar

1.00  Tue Jan 21 12:37:29 2004
	- Original version
